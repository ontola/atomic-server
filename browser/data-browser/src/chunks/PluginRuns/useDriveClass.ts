 * nobody knows yet, `{ ok: true, value: undefined }` means the drive was read
 * and has no such class. Most drives are the second case, so it must not
 * retry, and the page that asked must not keep asking.
 *
 * The drive resource is read FIRST, on its own, because `findSchema` cannot
 * tell those two apart: it reads `default-ontology` off the drive and returns
 * `{}` when there is none, which is exactly what an errored or unloaded drive
 * resource also looks like. That empty answer used to arrive as a successful
 * "this drive has no app class", the hook wrote `undefined` into state, and
 * nothing ever asked again, because the ontology subscription it sets up needs
 * the very ontology it failed to read. One unlucky read then rendered an app as
 * a bare list of its properties for as long as the tab stayed open. The website
 * class collapsed the same way until `874c5bd`.
 *
 * `fromServer` is what makes asking again worth anything. `getResource` answers
 * from the store's cache and returns a resource that once failed as-is:
 * `if (found.isReady() || found.error) return found`. So a second `getResource`
 * hands back the very same error for as long as the tab is open. A retry has to
 * go back to the source.
 *
 * Outside the hook so the React compiler does not have to reason about a
 * try/catch inside a component.
