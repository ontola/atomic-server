 * none of them is the one. `store.getResource` rejects on a cancelled request
 * and after its own 10s settle timeout, which a loaded machine reaches.
 *
 * `fromServer` is what makes asking again worth anything. `getResource`
 * answers from the store's cache, and it returns a resource that once failed
 * as-is: `if (found.isReady() || found.error) return found`. So a second
 * `getResource` after a failed read hands back the very same error, for as
 * long as the tab is open, and a resource left stuck on `loading` costs
 * another 10s settle timeout each time. A retry has to go back to the source.
 *
 * Outside the hook so the React compiler does not have to reason about a
 * try/catch inside a component.
