 * 2026-06-25).
 *
 * On a Managed Sync session whose account agent differs from the device agent:
 * - **Account has a restorable backup** (`recovery_agent`) → the account's
 *   identity wins: send the user to the welcome/recover flow ("unlock your
 *   data"), which replaces the local agent. When the local agent has (or may
 *   have) a workspace, first hand its drives to the account agent, copy
 *   its local-only drives for the account's database, and keep its key on
 *   the device (see `driveHandover.ts`), so the switch loses nothing. Asking which identity to keep (2026-09-03) put a question about
 *   agents in front of people who only know their account.
 * - **Same, but the handover failed** → ask, as a last resort: switching now
 *   could lock a workspace away. For an identity that never hosted anything
 *   the first answer is to bring its workspace along after all (the same
 *   handover, tried again); switching without it and keeping this identity
 *   stay as fallbacks. A hosted or synced identity is only ever kept: its
 *   drives' enrollments are tied to it, and the account cannot re-enroll
 *   them from here.
 * - **Otherwise** → adopt this device's agent (bind it to the account) so it
 *   becomes the account's agent. No prompt, no logout.
 *
 * With no Managed session (self-hosted / local-only), reconciliation is a no-op
 * and the agent is simply primary.
