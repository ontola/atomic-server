 * Handing a local identity's drives to the account identity that replaces it.

 * One email has one identity. When the account already has one and this
 * browser made another, the account's wins — but the browser's may already
 * own drives (a kept template preview, the home an invite created). Before
 * the switch, while the local agent can still sign, it adds the account agent
 * to each of those drives' `write`, and copies the local-only ones out of its
 * own database (`driveCarryOver.ts`). After the switch, the account imports
 * those copies and lists every handed-over drive in its own home, the way
 * `addToSavedDrives` does for the demo.
