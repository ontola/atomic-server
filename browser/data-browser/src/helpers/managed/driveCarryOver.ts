 * Carrying local-only drives from a replaced identity into the account's.
 *
 * A local-only drive (a demo guest's kept template) lives in its
 * identity's own encrypted database, and the switch opens the account's
 * database instead. `initClientDb` refuses to seed one identity's database
 * from another's in-memory resources: on a shared device that would hand one
 * person's data to whoever signs in next. This is the deliberate exception
 * for one person switching to their own account: only drives the old
 * identity could write and has just granted the account write on (see
 * `driveHandover.ts`), exported while its database is open, imported once the
 * account's is.
 *
 * Export and import are Cloud Vault's own (`vaultExport` / `vaultImport`),
 * with a throwaway key and pseudonym instead of the account's vault: a full
 * checkpoint of the drive's Loro history and signed envelopes, merged into
 * the target the way a restore is. Attachments are not part of a vault pack,
 * so their bytes travel alongside.
 *
 * Nothing is deleted: the old database keeps its copy, and the old identity
 * stays archived on the device.
