 * Properties the SERVER derives for a resource and that the client must never

 * They all have another source of truth: `lastCommit` is commit metadata,
 * `createdAt` and `createdBy` come from the genesis certificate (see
 * `Resource.getCreatedBy`). Writing one into Loro produces a LOCAL operation,
 * and a local operation means a dirty subject and a commit — for a value the
 * client never authored. On a resource you may write that is a redundant
 * commit per hydration; on one you may only READ, the server refuses it
 * forever, which is how an invitee who had written nothing ended up with a
 * blocked outbox entry and a permanent "changes pending".
 *
 * They stay in the read cache, so `resource.get()` and JSON-AD round-trips are
 * unaffected — which is why {@link SERVER_MANAGED_PROPS} includes them, and why
 * `Resource.merge` copies exactly this set from the incoming resource's cache:
 * a CRDT merge cannot carry a value that is in no Loro doc, so the incoming
 * (server-fresh) copy has to be taken by hand.
