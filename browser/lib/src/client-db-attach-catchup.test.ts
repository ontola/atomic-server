/**
 * Signing in swaps the anonymous local database for the agent's own one, and
 * `initClientDb` detaches the store's worker synchronously the moment the
 * identity changes — the replacement attaches seconds later, once its file is
 * open. Everything the server delivers in that window arrives at `addResource`
 * with no database to write to.
 *
 * Nothing re-adds a resource that was applied once, so those writes used to be
 * lost for the whole session: a drive sync landing in the window left its
 * resources in memory and out of the local index, `finishDriveSync` vouched for
 * the drive regardless, and `Collection.finishLocalDbPage` then treated the
 * empty index as authoritative and never asked the server. A second device
 * would open a drive and show none of its contents.
