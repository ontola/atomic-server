# Runs the atomic-server the e2e suite talks to, against a data directory of its
# own.
#
# Which port? Whatever the data-browser is configured to talk to —
# `VITE_ATOMIC_SERVER_URL`, which defaults to 9883 in
# `browser/data-browser/vite.config.ts` and is overridden by
# `.env.development.local` if present. This is easy to get wrong: the suite's
# own `SERVER_URL` (default 9883) only points the test *helpers*, while the app
# the tests drive uses the vite env. Start a server on 9883 while the SPA is
# pointed at 9885 and every test fails on a connection refused that names neither.
#
# A shell export of `VITE_ATOMIC_SERVER_URL` is not visible here (it belongs to
# whoever started vite, not to this script), so pass `ATOMIC_E2E_SERVER_URL`
# when the app was started that way.
#
# Why a separate store: sharing yours means every run adds drives, tables and
# rows to the store you actually work in, and a store with a few hundred runs'
# worth of that makes the suite fail on timing rather than on bugs — the totals
# footer and the template specs start losing races they win in isolation. A red
# run then tells you nothing.
#
#   ./scripts/e2e-server.sh              # start; wipes the store if it is oversized
#   ./scripts/e2e-server.sh --fresh      # wipe the e2e store first, always
#   ./scripts/e2e-server.sh --keep-store # keep an oversized store (warns instead)
#   ./scripts/e2e-server.sh --stale-ok   # start even if the binary predates its sources
#   ./scripts/e2e-server.sh --mock-proxy # also run the mock integration proxy
#
# Safe to wipe: this directory only ever holds test data.
#
# Two things this refuses to let you do silently, because both produce a
# failure list that looks like real bugs and is not:
#   - run against a store big enough to fail specs on timing (it wipes it)
#   - run against a binary older than its sources (it stops and tells you)

# the e2e server with `cargo build --locked --profile e2e`, and the workspace
# Cargo.toml defines that profile as release brought down to opt-level 2 with
# `debug-assertions` and `overflow-checks` deliberately left on. Its own comment
# says why: it is "an optimisation level where commit round-trips stop
# dominating".
#
# This script used to point straight at `target/debug`, and that is not a
# slower version of the same thing. At opt-level 0, with two Playwright workers,
# the app stops being able to BOOT: specs fail on a page whose whole snapshot is
# `img "AtomicServer"`, one of them after a 30s `waitForURL`, and the same file
# at `--workers=1` passes every time. Read as test failures those look like
# behaviour bugs or "CI shard contention", and they are neither. Anything
# concluded about timing from a debug binary is a measurement of the binary.
#
# A green on the slower build is still trustworthy, since a spec that passes at
# opt-level 0 passes at opt-level 2. A red is not evidence of anything.
