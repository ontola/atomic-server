//! Sync protocol — transport-agnostic drive synchronization.

//! Contains the v2 binary frame protocol and the sync engine.
//! Used by WebSocket (server), Iroh QUIC (native peers), and WASM clients.

// feature. The module itself stays ungated so `Storelike::sync_policy`
// (always compiled) can reference `sync::policy` in a no-features build.
