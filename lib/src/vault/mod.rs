//! Shared crypto for client-side envelope encryption: a random DEK encrypts

//! (`recovery.ts`, stored by atomic-saas) loads through `atomic-wasm`; that
//! backup's envelope format itself lives in TypeScript.
//!
//! The drive-level Cloud Vault key material lives here too
//! (`planning/CLOUD_VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md`).

// `chacha20poly1305`, and every host that can run a vault client already
// enables it (see the host table in CLOUD_VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md).
