//! A row that is edited until it no longer satisfies a filter must leave that
//! filter's results.
//!
//! The query index caches the members of every watched query, so a narrowed
//! view is answered from that cache rather than by re-scanning. Eviction is
//! therefore not an optimisation but the correctness condition: whatever writes
//! a resource has to delete the entries its *previous* values earned it.
//!
//! `apply_commit` gets this right by construction (it is handed both the old and
//! the new resource). `add_resource` — the path the browser's local database
//! takes for every write it makes, and the CLI's `--import` — only has the new
//! one, and used to evict against it. These tests pin the whole-resource write
//! path specifically, because that is the one that was wrong.
//! Run: cargo test -p atomic_lib --features db-redb --test query_index_eviction
