//! The one host behind every sandboxed plugin.
//!
//! Two guest contracts run on the server — the class extender (a wasip2
//! component that participates in reads and commits) and the JS `run` plugin
//! (QuickJS inside a wasip2 component, which only proposes) — but they share a
//! sandbox and, since this module, a host. Everything security-relevant that
//! both need lives here exactly once: which agent a read is authorized for,
//! which origins a fetch may reach, where a secret may be substituted, how
//! large a response may grow, and who may commit.
//!
//! `wasm.rs` and `js_runtime.rs` keep only what differs: the WIT bindings and
//! the component lifecycle. They translate their guest's types into the calls
//! below and back, and nothing else.
