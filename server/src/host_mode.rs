//! Who may put a *new* workspace on this node.
//!
//! A stock node admits every drive ([`atomic_lib::sync::policy::OpenPolicy`]).
//! On a laptop that is right: the person at the keyboard is the only one who
//! can reach it. On a public address it means the welcome screen is an open
//! registration form for free storage on somebody else's disk.
//!
//! [`HostMode::Owner`] closes that. It does not touch reading: what the owner
//! shared stays shared, invited collaborators keep working, and ACL on existing
//! resources is unchanged. The only new refusal is *enrolling a drive this node
//! has never hosted*.
//!
//! # Why the mode is not inferred from the domain
//!
//! The obvious heuristic — "`ATOMIC_DOMAIN` is not localhost, so we must be
//! public" — is wrong in the direction that costs data. `ATOMIC_DOMAIN`
//! defaults to `localhost` and only ever has to be correct for building links
//! and for the LetsEncrypt challenge. Behind Docker with nginx/Caddy/Traefik in
//! front, or behind a Cloudflare/Tailscale tunnel, the process never learns its
//! public name: the domain still reads `localhost` while the whole internet can
//! reach it. Inferring "Open" there would hand out exactly the guarantee we
//! could not keep.
//!
//! So the mode is decided by explicit configuration only, and the reachability
//! signals below are used for *one* thing: deciding whether to warn. A wrong
//! guess then costs a line of log noise instead of a stranger's workspace.
