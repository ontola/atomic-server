# JSON Schema

_status: draft_

An Ontology can be read from, and written as, a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) (draft 2020-12).
Every object schema becomes a [Class](classes.md), every entry of its `properties` becomes a [Property](property-identity.md), `required` becomes `requires`, and the keywords Atomic understands become the Class's [constraints](classes.md#constraints).

This is not a JSON Schema validator and not a complete mapping.
Import is strict: a construct Atomic cannot express is an error that names its JSON pointer, never silently dropped.

```ts
import { ensureOntology, ontologyFromJsonSchema, ontologyToJsonSchema } from '@tomic/lib';

const ontology = ontologyFromJsonSchema({
  title: 'Shop',
  'x-atomic-ontology': 'shop',
  $defs: {
    customer: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: { name: { type: 'string', minLength: 1 } },
      required: ['name'],
    },
    invoice: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        amount: { type: 'number', minimum: 0 },
        customer: { $ref: '#/$defs/customer' },
      },
    },
  },
});

// Find or create the Ontology, its Properties and Classes under `drive`.
const { ontology: subject, classes, properties } = await ensureOntology(store, drive, ontology);

// And back out again.
const schema = await ontologyToJsonSchema(store, subject);
```

`ontologyFromJsonSchema` returns the input of `ensureOntology`: shortname, name, description and classes, each with its properties, `requires`, `recommends` and `constraints`.
`ensureOntology` is idempotent.
Running it twice changes nothing, and the same input gives the same `atomic:prop:` Property subjects.

Rust has the same import and `ensure_ontology` in `atomic_lib::schema::json_schema`: `ontology_from_json_schema_str` (keeps the order of the keys; `ontology_from_json_schema` takes a parsed `serde_json::Value`, whose keys are alphabetical) and `ensure_ontology(store, parent, plan, agent)`.
Export is TypeScript only.
Both implementations run the cases in `lib/tests/fixtures/json-schema-interop.json`.

## Mapping

| JSON Schema | Atomic |
| --- | --- |
| Object schema in `$defs` | Class. The shortname is the key as a slug (`LineItem` becomes `line-item`), the name is the `title`, else the key |
| Root schema with `properties` | Class, named after the `title` |
| Root `title`, `description` | Ontology `name`, `description` |
| Root `x-atomic-ontology`, else slugified `title` | Ontology `shortname` |
| `properties` entry | Property, shortname is the key as a slug; `title` is its `name`, `description` its `description` |
| `required` | Class `requires`. The other properties are `recommends` |
| `type: string` | `string` |
| `type: string, format: date-time` | `timestamp` |
| `type: string, format: date` | `date` |
| `type: string, format: uri` | `atomicURL` |
| `type: integer` | `integer` |
| `type: number` | `float` |
| `type: boolean` | `boolean` |
| `$ref: "#/$defs/Name"` | `atomicURL` plus a `class` constraint pointing at that Class |
| `type: array` of `$ref` | `resourceArray` plus a `class` constraint |
| `type: array` of `{ type: string, format: uri }` | `resourceArray` |
| Other `type: array`, `type: object` | `json` |
| `enum`, `const` | `enum` constraint. Without a `type` the datatype follows the values. On an array, put it on `items` |
| `minimum`, `maximum`, `exclusiveMinimum`, `exclusiveMaximum` | the same constraint keyword |
| `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern` | the same constraint keyword |
| `minItems`, `maxItems` | the same constraint keyword |

The constraints are stored on the Class, keyed by the property's subject, not on the Property: Properties are immutable and only their shortname and datatype are part of their identity.
That also means two classes that both declare `name` as a string share one Property and can still constrain it differently.

`$comment`, `examples`, `default`, `deprecated`, `readOnly`, `writeOnly` and a root `$id` are annotations.
They are read and dropped.
`additionalProperties` may be a boolean and is dropped: Atomic classes are open.

## What does not map

Each of these is an error on import, naming the keyword's JSON pointer, for example `/$defs/Invoice/properties/status/oneOf`.

- `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`, `not`, `if`/`then`/`else`, `dependentSchemas`, `patternProperties`, `propertyNames`, `unevaluated*`, `prefixItems` and the other keywords that Atomic has no equivalent for.
- Nullable types (`type: ["string", "null"]`). Atomic has no null: leave the property out of the value instead.
- A `$ref` that is not a local `#/$defs/Name` to an object schema, a `$defs` entry that is not an object schema, and any keyword next to `$ref` other than `title`, `description` and `enum`.
- Object schemas nested inside a property (`properties` below a property). Move them to `$defs` and `$ref` them.
- `enum` or `const` on an array. It constrains the whole array in JSON Schema, but a class constraint applies to every item. Put it on `items`.
- A `format` other than `date-time`, `date` and `uri`, and any `type` other than `string`, `integer`, `number`, `boolean`, `array` and `object`.
- Boolean schemas, a `$schema` other than draft 2020-12, unknown `x-` keywords, and any other keyword.
- A property name that cannot become a [slug](datatypes.md#slug), two names that become the same shortname, and a shortname used with two datatypes in one Ontology (a Property is identified by shortname and datatype, and an Ontology cannot hold two with one shortname).

Items of a `json` array are not described: `{ type: array, items: { type: string } }` imports as plain `json`.

## `x-atomic-*` keywords

These carry what JSON Schema cannot say, so that an export imports again as the same Ontology.

| Keyword | Where | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `x-atomic-ontology` | root | The Ontology's shortname |
| `x-atomic-datatype` | property | The exact Atomic datatype, when `type` and `format` are not enough: `markdown`, `slug`, `uri`, `json`, `lorodoc`, `localizedText`. Wins over the datatype that `type` implies |
| `x-atomic-class` | property, or `items` of an array | The `class` constraint of a link, for a class outside the schema (a subject), or a class in it (a shortname) |
| `x-atomic-property` | property, export only | The property's `atomic:prop:` subject |
| `x-atomic-subject` | root and classes, export only | The Ontology's or Class's subject |

`x-atomic-property` and `x-atomic-subject` are for readers.
Import ignores them: a Property's identity follows from its Ontology, shortname and datatype, and is never taken on trust from a document.

## Export

`ontologyToJsonSchema(store, ontology)` writes a draft 2020-12 schema with one `$defs` entry per Class and `properties` keyed by shortname.
A `class` constraint on a Class of the same Ontology becomes a `$ref` to its entry, any other becomes `x-atomic-class`.

Import followed by `ensureOntology` followed by export gives the input back, with these normalisations:

- `$defs` keys are the class name when that is an identifier whose slug is the shortname (`LineItem`), else the shortname. Property keys are always shortnames: `unitPrice` becomes `unit-price`.
- `title` is left out when it equals the key or shortname, and `description` when it equals the name.
- A `json` property is written as `{ "x-atomic-datatype": "json" }`, without its `type`.
- `const` becomes a one-item `enum`, and an `enum` without a `type` gains the type of its values.
- Annotations and `additionalProperties` are gone, `required: []` is omitted, and `$schema`, `x-atomic-ontology`, `x-atomic-subject` and `x-atomic-property` are added.
- A property shared by two classes has one `title` and `description`: those of the first class that declared it.

An export is a fixed point: importing it and exporting again changes nothing.
