**Atomic Data is a modular specification for sharing, modifying and modeling graph data. It combines the ease of use of JSON, the connectivity of RDF (linked data) and the reliability of type-safety.**

Atomic Data uses links to connect pieces of data, and therefore makes it easier to connect datasets to each other - even when these datasets exist on separate machines.

It is also [local-first](local-first.md): your identity is a key you hold, your data lives on your own devices, every edit is signed by you, and devices [sync](sync.md) with each other whenever they can. A server is optional, useful as an always-on replica rather than as the place your data has to live.

## AtomicServer

[AtomicServer](atomic-server.md) is an open source, powerful graph database + headless CMS.
It's the reference implementation for the Atomic Data specification, written in Rust.
The same library, `atomic_lib`, runs in the browser (as WASM), in [Flutter apps](flutter.md) and in the CLI, so every client keeps a full local copy of its data and does its own signing and syncing.

## Atomic Data Core

Atomic Data has been designed with [the following goals in mind](motivation.md):

- Give people more control over their data
- Make linked data easier to use
- Make it easier for developers to build highly interoperable apps
- Make standardization easier and cheaper

Atomic Data is [Linked Data](https://ontola.io/blog/what-is-linked-data/), as it is a [strict subset of RDF](interoperability/rdf.md).
It is type-safe (you know if something is a `string`, `number`, `date`, `URL`, etc.) and extensible through [Atomic Schema](schema/intro.md), which means that you can re-use or define your own Classes, Properties and Datatypes.

The default serialization format for Atomic Data is [JSON-AD](core/json-ad.md), which is simply JSON where each key is a URL of an Atomic Property.
These Properties are responsible for setting the `datatype` (to ensure type-safety) and setting `shortnames` (which help to keep names short, for example in JSON serialization) and `descriptions` (which provide semantic explanations of what a property should be used for).

## Atomic Data Extended

Atomic Data Extended is a set of extra modules (on top of Atomic Data Core) that deal with identity, data that changes over time, authentication, authorization and synchronization between devices.
If you are new here, read [URLs and identifiers](urls.md) first: it explains the `did:ad:` identifiers that show up everywhere in Extended.

## Tools & libraries

- The web app ([demo on atomicdata.dev](https://atomicdata.dev)): documents, tables, chat, files and an ontology editor, working offline in the browser
- Build a web app with [@tomic/lib](js.md), [@tomic/react](usecases/react.md) or [@tomic/svelte](svelte.md)
- Build a native app with [Flutter / Dart](flutter.md), on top of the same Rust core
- Host your own always-on [atomic-server](atomicserver/installation.md) (powers [atomicdata.dev](https://atomicdata.dev), run with `docker run -p 80:80 -v atomic-storage:/atomic-storage ghcr.io/ontola/atomic-server`), or use [Atomic Cloud](https://atomicserver.eu)
- Discover the command line tool: [atomic-cli](rust-cli.md) (`cargo install atomic-cli`)
- Use the Rust library: [atomic_lib](rust-lib.md)

## Status

Keep in mind that none of the Atomic Data projects has reached a v1, which means that breaking changes can happen.

## Reading these docs

This is written mostly as a book, so reading it in the order of the Table of Contents will probably give you the best experience.
That being said, feel free to jump around - links are often used to refer to earlier discussed concepts.
