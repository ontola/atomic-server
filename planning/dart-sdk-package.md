# Dart SDK as a published package

> **Status:** Proposal (2026-09-18). Nothing moved yet. Written alongside the

## Goal

`flutter/lib/atomic/` is a general-purpose Atomic Data SDK (`AtomicClient`,
`AtomicStore`, `AtomicSession`, `atomic_auth.dart`, the FRB bridge) that
happens to live inside Atomic Canvas. Extract it into a package other Flutter
apps can depend on, so the docs can say `flutter pub add atomic_data` instead
of "vendor this folder".

## What is general and what is canvas

| General (moves) | Canvas-only (stays) |
| --- | --- |
| `openDb`, agent setup / load, drives, `getProperty` / `setProperty` | `createCanvas*`, `loadCanvasStrokes`, `listCanvases*`, folders, thumbnails |
| history (`warmResourceHistory`, `getResourceHistory`, `getResourceAtVersion`) | `wsSubscribeCanvas` |
| peer sync (`startPeer`, `peerSync`, `peerAnnounce`, `peerDiscoverSync`, known peers) | stroke models, gallery, canvas painter |
| WS sync (`openWsSync`, `syncDriveToServer`, `resumeSession`, `pollDbEvent`) | |
| `atomic_auth.dart` (pure-Dart request signing) | |
| `server_url.dart`, `server_info.dart`, `session.dart` | |
| `widgets/` sync + settings screens (twins of `SyncRoute` in the browser) | |

The Rust side (`flutter/rust/src/api/simple/`) has the same split: `state.rs`,
`ws_sync.rs` and the peer functions are general; the `CANVAS_*` constants and
stroke functions are not.

## Shape

```
flutter/
  packages/
    atomic_data/            # the SDK: Dart + rust_builder + FRB config
      lib/
      rust/                 # today's flutter/rust, minus canvas api
      rust_builder/
      pubspec.yaml          # name: atomic_data
  apps/
    atomic_canvas/          # today's flutter/, depends on ../packages/atomic_data
```

`flutter_rust_bridge` generates bindings per crate, so the canvas keeps a
small FRB crate of its own for stroke functions, depending on `atomic_data`'s
crate for the store. Alternatively expose a generic `callAction(json)` from the
SDK and keep canvas logic in Dart; decide after measuring the stroke path.

## Steps

- [ ] Split `flutter/rust/src/api/simple.rs` into `atomic` (general) and
      `canvas` modules; make `canvas` depend on `atomic`'s `db()` / `node()`.
- [ ] Create `flutter/packages/atomic_data` with its own `pubspec.yaml`,
      `flutter_rust_bridge.yaml` and `rust_builder`; move the general Dart
      files and the generated `src/rust/` bindings.
- [ ] Point Atomic Canvas at the package with a path dependency; keep
      `make phone` / `make tablet` / `make web` working.
- [ ] Move the Dart unit tests in `flutter/test/atomic/` (URL rules, pairing
      parsing, signing parity with Rust) with the package.
- [ ] CI: `cargo test --manifest-path flutter/packages/atomic_data/rust/Cargo.toml`
      replaces the current `flutter/rust` invocation in `AGENTS.md` and the
      dagger job.
- [ ] Publish `atomic_data` to pub.dev from the `v*` tag, the same trigger that
      publishes `@tomic/*` to npm (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).
- [ ] Update `docs/src/flutter.md` (install line, import path) and
      `docs/src/tooling.md`.

## Open questions

- Package name: `atomic_data` vs `tomic` (matching the npm scope). Prefer
  `atomic_data`; the npm scope exists only because `atomic` was taken.
- The web target: FRB compiles to WASM, but the browser already has the
  `wasm/` crate through `@tomic/lib`. One WASM build or two? Not blocking for
  mobile.
- Whether `AtomicStore` (the `ChangeNotifier`) belongs in the SDK or in a
  separate `atomic_data_flutter` package, keeping the core pure Dart.
