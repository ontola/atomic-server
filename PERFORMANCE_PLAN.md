# Performance Plan — DID/WS Branch

The new DID/WS branch (`did-rebased2`) feels noticeably slower than
master, even though the binary WS protocol should be faster than the
old JSON commit/text-message scheme. This document captures the
investigation, the bottlenecks, and the rollout order for fixes.

The runtime profiler that produces the numbers below is wired up in
`browser/data-browser/src/helpers/profiler.tsx`. Reload, hit
**Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P**, look at the two console tables.

## Hot paths (mapped against actual code)

A WS UPDATE → React re-render goes through this chain. Every link is on
the critical path.

| # | Function | File:line | Called per WS UPDATE |
|---|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| 1 | `WSClient.handleBinary` UPDATE branch | `lib/src/websockets.ts:467` | 1 |
| 2 | `Resource.importLoroUpdate` | `lib/src/resource.ts:1922` | 1 |
| 3 | `Resource.rebuildCacheFromLoro` | `lib/src/resource.ts:487` | 1 (full rebuild) |
| 4 | `Store.addResource` | `lib/src/store.ts:830` | 1 |
| 5 | `Store.notify` | `lib/src/store.ts:3011` | 1 |
| 6 | `StoreEvents.ResourceUpdated` listeners | per `useCollection` mounted | N collections |
| 7 | `Collection.applyResourceChange` | `lib/src/collection.ts:195` | N collections |
| 8 | per-subject subscriber callbacks | per `useResource` for that subject | M components |
| 9 | `proxyResource` (new Proxy) | `lib/src/resource.ts:2073` | M components |
| 10 | React render of every `useResource` consumer | depends on tree | M components |

For an initial drive-open this fans out to ~50 incoming UPDATEs ×
~5 collections × ~10 active `useResource` calls = a *lot* of redundant
work, almost all of which was a no-op for the user.

## Bottlenecks ranked by impact

### B1 — `proxyResource()` breaks referential equality every notify  *(largest)*

```ts
// browser/lib/src/resource.ts:2073
return new Proxy(resource.__internalObject, {});
```

Empty handler. Its only function is to defeat `useState`'s `Object.is`
check so React re-renders. Three call sites in `useResource`
(`react/src/hooks.ts:67/77/100`) — every WS notify and every
`LoadingChange` builds a new object, which downstream `useValue`,
`useTitle`, memoised children all see as "changed".

**Cost shape**: `O(subscribed_resources × incoming_updates)` allocations
per second on commit bursts. Pages with many cells (tables, sidebars)
are worst.

**Fix**: migrate `useResource` / `useCollection` to React 18's
`useSyncExternalStore`. Per-subject `subscribe`/`getSnapshot`; React
uses identity equality on the *snapshot value* but only re-renders the
hook caller — no proxy wrapping, no fan-out re-renders.

**Effort**: medium (half a day). Needs `getServerSnapshot` for SSR
parity but Atomic doesn't SSR so we can stub it.

---

### B2 — global `ResourceUpdated` fan-out + linear page scan

`useCollection.ts:183` registers one global `ResourceUpdated` listener
per mounted collection. Inside (`collection.ts:195`):

```ts
const propVal = resource?.get(fp);
const matches = ...;
for (const [pageIdx, page] of this.pages) {
  const members = page.getSubjects(...);
  const idx = members.indexOf(subject);   // O(members)
}
```

Sidebar + main + breadcrumbs ≈ 5–10 collections; *each* visits *every*
incoming UPDATE.

**Cost shape**: `O(collections × pages × members_per_page)` array scans
per UPDATE.

**Fixes**:
1. *Quick*: index members in a `Set<string>` per page (or a
   `Map<subject, {pageIdx, arrayIdx}>` per collection) → page scan
   becomes O(1).
2. *Quick*: skip the loop entirely when `matches === false` *and* the
   resource isn't already a known member.
3. *Slower*: index collections by `(property, value)` in the store, so
   `Store.notify` only wakes collections whose filter could possibly
   match.

**Effort**: small (#1 + #2 together is ~30 minutes).

---

### B3 — `rebuildCacheFromLoro` is full-rebuild

`resource.ts:487-499` exports the entire Loro map to JSON and rebuilds
`_cache` from scratch on *every* import. A 20-property resource that
changed 1 property pays the cost of all 20.

Loro has container events (`subscribe`) that report changed keys.

**Cost shape**: `O(properties)` per WS UPDATE; with N resources synced
on drive open, N × P operations.

**Fix**: subscribe to the `LoroMap` per resource on creation, mutate
`_cache` only for changed keys. Drop the full-rebuild calls in
`merge` / `importLoroUpdate` / lazy `getLoroDoc` (the lazy path can stay
full since it's once-per-resource-lifetime).

**Effort**: medium (Loro API + careful invariant work — the cache
must always reflect Loro's view, including deletions).

---

### B4 — `useResource` registers 3 listeners per call

```ts
useEffect(() => store.subscribe(...));            // notify path
useEffect(() => resource.stable.on(LocalChange));  // if track set
useEffect(() => resource.stable.on(LoadingChange));// always
```

For 100 mounted `useResource` calls that's 200–300 active listeners.
Notify fan-out is linear in listener count. Each listener path leads
back to `proxyResource` (B1).

**Fix**: collapses naturally once B1 lands —
`useSyncExternalStore` replaces all three with one external
subscription. As a stop-gap, the `LoadingChange` listener could be
omitted when `resource.loading === false` at mount time (it never
flips back to true).

**Effort**: trivial as a stop-gap; folds into B1's fix otherwise.

---

### B5 — `Resource.merge` deep-clones cache and auxValues

Two `structuredClone` calls per merge for resources that don't yet have
a Loro doc (`resource.ts:823-836`). The source resource is thrown away
after `addResource`, so the clones were defensive against a bug that
can't happen.

**Fix**: take ownership of `_cache`, shallow-copy the `_auxValues` Map.

**Effort**: trivial. *Done — see commit `e89c9da3`.*

---

### B6 — `useChildren` awaits members sequentially

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < collection.totalMembers; i++) {
  const member = await collection.getMemberWithIndex(i);
}
```

200-child folder = 200 × worker RTT before the tree renders.

**Fix**: `Promise.all(Array.from({ length: total }, (_, i) =>
collection.getMemberWithIndex(i)))`.

**Effort**: trivial. *Done — see commit `e89c9da3`.*

---

### B7 — SUB pushes always force notify

`websockets.ts` always calls `addResources(resource, { skipCommitCompare: true })`
on subscription pushes. The store's `lastCommit` gate would otherwise
short-circuit notify when the value hasn't changed — but it can't,
because the WS handler mutates the resource *in place*, so by the time
the gate runs `storeResource === resource` and the comparison is
trivially true.

The server echoes back commits we just sent (same `commitId`); each
echo currently triggers a full notify storm.

**Fix**: capture `lastCommit` *before* `importLoroUpdate`, compare
against the commit announced in the push; if equal, skip
`addResources` (persistence + blob checks still run, they're
idempotent).

**Effort**: trivial. *Done — see commit `e89c9da3`.*

---

### B8 — `Resource.title` reads four properties per render

`resource.ts:199-205`. Falls through `name → shortname → filename →
description → subject`. Each `.get()` checks `_cacheDirty` and may
trigger a full Loro rebuild (B3 amplifies this).

**Fix**: memoise the title at the resource level, invalidate on
relevant property change. Or, more cheaply, after B1 lands the cost
collapses because re-renders are massively reduced.

**Effort**: small.

---

## Profiler usage

The runtime profiler is always-on in dev. After reproducing a slow
flow, hit **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P** to dump:

- **Render table** — sorted by total ms; columns `id`, `phase`,
  `count`, `totalMs`, `avgMs`, `maxMs`, `slowRenders` (>16ms).
- **Events table** — `store.ResourceUpdated`, `store.ResourceSaved`,
  `ws.in.UPDATE`, `ws.out.GET`, …, with sample payloads.

Useful patterns:

- **`store.ResourceUpdated` ≫ `ws.in.UPDATE`** → local commits, OPFS
  rehydrations, or echo pushes are firing notifies. Look at sample
  payloads to identify the subject.
- **High `ws.out.GET` count** → too many fetches. Likely a `useResource`
  loop or missing cache. Drill into who's mounting.
- **High `count` + low `avgMs`** on one Profiler id → re-rendering too
  often (B1 / B4 territory).
- **Low `count` + high `maxMs`** → expensive single render. Wrap that
  subtree with `<PerformanceProfiler id="X">` to drill in, then use
  React DevTools Profiler for per-fiber attribution.

`window.__atomicProfiler.reset()` between scenarios for clean numbers.

## Roll-out order

| Step | Win | Status |
|------|-----|--------|
| B5 | drop `structuredClone` in `merge` no-Loro path | ✅ `e89c9da3` |
| B6 | `Promise.all` `getMemberWithIndex` | ✅ `e89c9da3` |
| B7 | echo-detection on SUB pushes | ✅ `e89c9da3` |
| B2 | subject→page index + early-bail in `applyResourceChange` | ✅ `d8ca1f39` |
| Bonus | drop OPFS `putResource` verification round-trip | ✅ `0fe9113a` |
| Bonus | skip `LoadingChange` listener for already-loaded resources | ✅ `43704c6c` |
| Cold | combine `getResource` + `getLoroSnapshot` into one worker round-trip | ✅ `59280b3d` |
| Cold | split `waitForReady` so useResource only waits for worker init, not bootstrap seed | ✅ `eefacc48` |
| Cold | batch the 70 sequential property-seed puts (and the 200-entry reseedAll) into one worker call each | ✅ `eefacc48` |
| Cold | parallelise `getAgentFromIDB` + `enableLoro` in App.tsx top-level | ✅ `40a55b3a` |
| Cold | `<link rel="preload">` for OPFS worker's WASM module + binary in index.html | ✅ `40a55b3a` |
| B8 | memoise `Resource.title` | ⏭ skipped — only 1 hashmap lookup in the common case (`name` set), not on the hot path |
| B1 | replace `proxyResource` with `useSyncExternalStore` | ⏸ deferred — every component touching `useValue` depends on `resource !== prevResource` to detect updates; pulling the proxy out without refactoring `useValue`/`useTitle` to subscribe per-property would silently freeze them. The cheaper wins above remove most of the proxy's per-update cost. |
| B3 | incremental `rebuildCacheFromLoro` via Loro container events | ⏸ deferred — Loro emits events on the next microtask, so the existing rebuild-after-import is needed for correctness; gain would be limited to the `merge`/`importLoroUpdate` hot path. Profile the suite once the round above lands and revisit. |
| B4 | folds into B1 | partial — `LoadingChange` listener now skipped when not needed |

Measure before/after each step with the profiler. The first three
should already produce a visible improvement on commit-burst flows
(typing into a chatroom, fast row entry, etc.) and on cold drive-open
with deep folder trees.

## Regression detection — benchmarks

`browser/lib/src/perf-hot-paths.bench.ts` covers the hot paths
documented above. Run with:

```sh
cd browser/lib
pnpm bench
```

Each suite targets one bottleneck. Compare *factor* changes — runner
variance makes single-percent drift meaningless. If a bench suddenly
runs 2× slower, look at the row in the rollout table that mentions the
same path and check it hasn't been undone.

Approximate baselines on an M1 Mac laptop (Node 22, vitest 2.1, May 2026):

| Bench | hz (ops/sec) | Bottleneck it tracks |
|-------|--------------|----------------------|
| `Resource.get(name)` cache hit | ~34M | B8 — per-render reads |
| `Resource.title` falls through to `.name` | ~35M | B8 |
| `Resource.loading` already-loaded | ~42M | B4 — per-render checks |
| `Resource.merge` rebuild cache | ~12M | B3 — Loro cache rebuild |
| `addResource` same lastCommit (gated) | ~1.9M | B7 — gate keeps notify off |
| `addResource` skipCommitCompare:true (forced) | ~1.0M | base WS UPDATE cost |
| `addResource → notify` with 50 subscribers | ~470K | B1 / fan-out |
| `applyResourceChange` unrelated (fast bail) | ~31M | B2 — index lookup |
| `applyResourceChange` member match | ~29M | B2 — Set bail vs page scan |
| `proxyResource()` Proxy alloc | ~29M | B1 |

The bench file is auto-excluded from `vitest run` (test files and
bench files share the directory but vitest only runs benches in `bench`
mode), so unit-test CI is unaffected. Benches aren't currently wired
into CI — runner variance is too high for a hard gate — but the
script is one command and worth running locally before merging perf-
adjacent changes.

## Out of scope / not bottlenecks

- **Loro WASM init cost** — happens once per session, irrelevant after.
- **OPFS round-trips** — fire-and-forget from the hot path; the
  serialised worker queue means ordering is guaranteed without
  awaiting.
- **WS frame decoding** — binary protocol is much faster than the old
  JSON; profiler shows it's a small fraction of per-update time.
- **Tantivy / search index** — not on the data-browser hot path at all
  (server-side concern; only visible on `/search`).

If the profiler ever shows otherwise, this section should be moved up.
